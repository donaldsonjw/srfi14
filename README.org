* SRFI-14: Character-set Library

** Description
  The srfi14 library is an implementation of [[https://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-14/srfi-14.html][SRFI 14]] for Bigloo
  scheme. It is an adaption of the sample implentation.

  Both the native and jvm backends are supported. The test suite is
  based on [[https://github.com/donaldsonjw/srfi64][SRFI 64]] and needs to be installed before running.
  
** Building
  Both the bigloo native and jvm backends are supported. To build,
  execute:
    #+begin_src shell
  ./configure --prefix=<installation path prefix>; make
#+end_src
  where =<installation path prefix>= is the desired installation path
  prefix (e.g, =/usr/local=). You usually want the path prefix to match
  that used by Bigloo itself.

#+begin_src shell
  make install
#+end_src
